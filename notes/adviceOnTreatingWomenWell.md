-texturism: this is considered to be discrimination based on hair texture (straighter hair is often times viewed as more favorable as kinky hair). We should be mindful of this and support a woman's hair texture regardless of which hair texture she has. We should support her in letting her wear whichever hair style she likes.

-colorism: this is discrimination based on skin tone (lighter skin is often viewed as more favorable than darker skin). We should not talk down on a woman's skin tone or request that a woman should have a certain skin tone.

-featurism: discrimination based on features (eurocentric features are often viewed more favorable than afrocentric features). We should not request that a woman's figure needs to look a certain way. We should support whichever figure she has.

Black women tend to be a victim of texturism/colorism/featurism at a significantly higher rate than non-black women, which makes research on the topic more important.

Black women appear to be objectified/viewed as a sexual object at a higher rate tha non-black women. We should never objectify women. We should view women as normal human-beings like any other people. A woman should be able to wear whatever she wants without objectification. We should not police what a woman wears. Let her wear whatever she wants.

When a woman is speaking, do not interupt her. Let her speak and listen to her.

When a woman experiences some complications, listen to her and empathize with her. Validate her emotions and thoughts.

Do not raise your voice at a woman or put your hands on her.

Do not use any derogatory words towards women.

When in a relationship with a woman, periodically request feedback on how you can do a better job.

Uplift and empower your woman.

Try and take the steps necessary to ensure your children grow up in a two-parent household. This increases the chance that the child is successful. It is good to aim to only have children after marriage in order to make the child more likely to grow up in a two-parent household. If you got your woman pregnant and you are not married, really consider marrying her!

When a man is degrading a woman, step up and defend the woman. Tell the man to knock it off and that their behavior is inappropriate.
