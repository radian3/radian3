### Conventions used in this document <a name = "conventions"></a>

1. In an effort to be less verbose, the word "Hispanic" is used in place of "Hispanic or Latino". In actuality, Hispanic and Latino are different. Someone may be both Hispanic and Latino, only Hispanic, only Latino, or neither.  
2. In an effort to be less verbose, "NH" is used to denote "Not Hispanic or Latino."  
3. If a race doesn't have NH specifically mentioned in the table, it is assumed that this statistic includes people who are Hispanic or Latino in the statistic (as well as including people who are not Hispanic or Latino). So "White" would include people who are Hispanic or Latino as well as people who are not Hispanic or Latino. "NH White" would be white people who are not Hispanic or Latino.  
4. All statistics are USA statistics on the country level unless otherwise specified.  
5. Table rows are generally sorted from most favorable to least favorable. This is for metrics where it is generally known if a higher number is considered good or bad (ex: homicide rates, educational attainment, income, etc.). Metrics that aren't generally able to be considered favorable or unfavorable are not sorted in any particular order (ex: political affiliation, interracial marriage rates, etc.).  
6. This document does not tend to communicate trends or how numbers have changed over time. This document tends to only communicate a snapshot of the present day situation. Some sources linked in the document may include additional information, including trends.  
7. I try to use the most reliable source at all times. I tend to favor government sources over non-government sources.  
8. I try to use the most recent source when possible. If a source is from a few years ago, that means that this was the most recent reliable source that I was able to locate.  
9. I do not attempt to explain the reason why some numbers are what they are. I simply just report the numbers that I found.  
10. In most scenarios in this document, ethnicity just refers to Hispanic/Non-Hispanic.

This table was made from doing calculations from the table above it. The chance of having a father in the household is the chance of having a two parent household plus the chance of having a one parent household that is male-led with no spouse present. The chance of having a mother in the household is calculated similarly.

|Race/Ethnicity of child|% of children in a single parent household that live with the father|% of children in a single parent household that live with the mother|
|---|---|---|
|Asian|30.7%|69.3%|
|White|30.3%|69.7%|
|Hispanic|26.5%|73.5%|
|Black|13.6%|86.4%|

This table was also made from doing calculations from the first table in this section. This table is looking at all children who are growing up in a one parent household and mentioning which of these children are growing up with the mother vs the father.
