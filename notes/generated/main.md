### Notes
- All data is queried from the UC Census 2020 American Community Survey 5 year estimates API
- The data for each location is an estimate. This means that locations of a smaller population would have more sampling error due to a smaller sample size. For this reason, I have excluded all locations that have less than 1000 people    
- The largest number the US Census is able to report for income for a location is $250001. This is why there may be multiple locations at the top of some lists that have $250001 listed as the income  
- In some scenarios, the US Census may not have data for a particular metric for certain locations. In scenarios in which data is missing for certain locations, I have excluded those locations from the tables  
- Per the US Census, someone who is Hispanic or Latino may be of any race. Thus, data above will include Hispanic or Latino individuals unless it specifically states "Not Hispanic or Latino." I may choose to add data in the future that is specifically for Hispanic or Latino people. I may also choose to add a category for White people who are not Hispanic or Latino
