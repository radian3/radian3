## Optimal strategy for men on clubhouse to learn how to treat women better

So do men or women on clubhouse generally have a better feel for how men can treat women with respect? Well it's not men because 90% of men on clubhouse treat women terribly. So I'm going to say that women know more about how men can treat women right. Is it because they don't like women or is it because they don't know how to treat women better? I predict it's mostly both. But this article is for the later.

Cool! You have now learned something. You have now leveled up from a level 0 man to a level 1 man. Each time you learn, your level will go up.

So all you have to do is ask women which things men need to do? NO!!!! You will learn why in around one minute from now.

Here is what you want to do. Go in women-led spaces that are talking about men. Don't say anything in the chat and don't go on stage. You are a level 1 man right now. Typing something in the chat or going on stage is too risky at level 1 because you don't know what you are doing and might say something that will get you kicked out of the room.
