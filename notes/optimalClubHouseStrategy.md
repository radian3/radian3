## Optimal strategy for men on clubhouse to learn how to treat women better

So do men or women on clubhouse generally have a better feel for how men can treat women with respect? Well it's not men because 90% of men on clubhouse treat women terribly. So I'm going to say that women know more about how men can treat women right. Is it because they don't like women or is it because they don't know how to treat women better? I predict it's mostly both. But this article is for the later.

*Item #1: Women on clubhouse tend to have a better understanding of how men can treat women with respect*

Cool! You have now learned something. You have now leveled up from a level 0 man to a level 1 man. Each time you learn, your level will go up.

So all you have to do is ask women which things men need to do? NO!!!! You will learn why in around one minute from now.

Here is what you want to do. Go in women-led spaces that are venting about men. Don't say anything in the chat and don't go on stage. You are a level 1 man right now. Typing something in the chat or going on stage is too risky at level 1 because you don't know what you are doing and might say something that will get you kicked out of the room. All you have to do is listen. At some point, there will be a conversation on stage like this:

Woman #1: In my past, I have had some bad experiences with men where _____________________ happened.
Woman #2: *shares her story, which is similar to woman #1*
Woman #3: *shares her story, which is similar to woman #1*
Man #1: So what do men need to do? How can men do better?
Woman #1, 2, and 3 at the same time: It is not women's responsibility to teach men how to treat women. Go talk to other men about that.

*Item #2: Women on clubhouse tend to not be interested in "teaching" men how to treat women*

Now that you have learned something else, you are now level 2! Now, I know what you are thinking. Item #1 states that women know better about how men can treat women with respect but Item #2 states that women don't want to teach men. Aren't we in a bit of a predicament here? The answer is no. We can still get all of the information we need from women. But how? You'll see in a moment.


a man will come up on stage and say "well I don't know about the men that you ladies have been in contact with but I just want to let you that there are good men out there.
