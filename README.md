<h2>The most important thing in life</h2>
The most important thing in life is to be as happy as possible for as long as possible. Instead of viewing your happiness as 0 or 100, you should view your happiness as 0-100. So you view your happiness as a number from 0 (no happiness) to 100 (as happy as possible). Instead of saying "I just want to be happy", you should say "I want to be as happy as possible." Two people may both be happy but one might be quite a bit more happier than the other. Be as happy as possible. 
 
This works for almost any decision in life. Which career should I go into? Go into the one that will make you as happy as possible. Which city should my family move to? Move to the city that will make your family as happy as possible. 
 
<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
I think there should be no discrimination based on race. At an initial glance, Affirmative Action may feel like discrimination as it gives certain people preference over others. But, I think Affirmative Action justified. There are certain groups of people that face discrimination in the United States and have a tougher life because of it. As a result of this, Affirmative Action has been brought in to try and help reduce the inequity. I think Affirmative Action makes sense to have at the moment since even with Affirmative Action, men still out-earn women and white people still out-earn minorities. If we get to a point where there is no/minimal discrimination based on gender/race, then it would make sense to remove Affirmative Action. 
 
<h2>Abortion</h2>
Because I don't have a medical background, I don't feel that I can confidently know what the abortion laws should be. I feel like this is something that needs to be determined by a panel of medical experts. The panel should probably be something like 2/3 women and 1/3 men because 
-the abortion is performed on the woman 
-the pregnancy would be formed from DNA of both the man and woman 
 
At the moment, I am not opposed to abortion being legal and I do not look down on a woman who chooses to get an abortion. 
 
<h2>Same-Sex marriage</h2>
I think same-sex marriage should be legal. Having same-sex marriage being legal does not harm me in any way. In addition to that, it will help make another group of people much happier. 
 
<h2>Interracial Dating/Marriage</h2> 
I think that when it comes to finding a partner, you want to think about what is going to make you happiest. 
 
Some people want their partner to have the same race as them so they can relate in certain areas and better understand each other. I don't see anything wrong with that. If that is what is going to make you happiest then you should date within your race. 
 
Some people may happen to date outside of their race. I don't see a problem with that as long as there is no fetishization/objectification going on. You have to date whoever will make you happiest. Sometimes, that might be someone outside of their race. Sometimes, I will see people who date outside of their race bash their own race. I also think that it is important for people who date outside of their race to not be putting down their own race of men/women as they date outside of their race. 
 
<h2>Should you go to college? If so, how do you determine which major should you choose? 
I think you want to brainstorm which career will make you happiest and then do whichever college education is necessary for that career. Why not just brainstorm which field of study will be the most fun to study in college and then major in that? Well, the career you have may last you 40 years whereas college is only going to last you 2-10 years (4 years for most) depending on what you are studying in college. Wouldn't you much rather do something you love for 40 years as opposed to only 2-10 years? 
 
Okay, I was slightly misleading there. I don't think everyone should go to college. Depending on the career that will make you happiest, it may or may not be worth it to go to college. If it is worth it to go to college, follow the advice of the previous paragraph. Otherwise, don't go to college. 
 
<h2>Legal/Illegal Immigration 
I don't view people who were born in a different country than me as less important. A person does not choose which country they are born in. So I think that people from other countries need to have the ability to come to my country. I think there does need to be some restrictions/vetting in order to determine who is eligible to enter our country. For example, we only have a limited number of jobs, housing, and other resources so we do have to have some limit in terms of how many people can be admitted to our country. I think that we certainly hope to be primarily admitting people who are in good standing with their country. 
 
For the most part, I feel like I am leaning towards being more lenient about allowing others into our country. I get that certain approaches of allowing others to our country can lower the quality of life of people in our country. I hear people saying things to the effects of "they are stealing our jobs." I don't know. I want to do more research on the topic and then add more thoughts to this section later. 
 
As far as illegal immigration goes, I also want to do more research on that too. I do not personally feel bothered by the amount of illegal immigration that our country has at the moment. 
 
<h2>Children born out of wedlock 
If I have kids, I hope for them to have a very high quality of life. I hope for them to be successful. Kids who grow up in two parent households are much more likely to be successful. For this reason, I am only open to having kids if I am already married. I just want to take the steps to increase the chance that kids grow up in a two-parent household. 
 
I think things can go unexpectedly wrong and you may end up raising a child in a one-parent household. I understand. I think you want to just give your best effort to try and take the right steps and then if you end up raising a child in a one-parent household, that's fine. 
 
<h2>Colorblindness and the "I don't see color" saying 
Each person can be placed into one of three categories: 
1) those who see race and don't discriminate 
2) those who do not see race and don't discriminate (colorblind) 
3) those who see race and discriminate 
 
I consider 1) to be the best type of person followed by 2) and then 3). What's wrong with 2)? If you aren't discriminating based on race, you aren't contributing to racism, right? I think that's probably true. But the fact that you do not see race means that you probably  
aren't contributing to reducing racism either. So that's the problem. Maybe you witness a racial incident but because you don't see color, you believe it was not a racial incident and thus you don't report it or intervene. 
 
If we didn't have anyone part of 3) in the world, then I think being in 2) would be totally fine. But because we have people in 3), we need people in 1) to combat the people in 3). 
 
<h2>Should schools discuss slavery? Race? 
It seems some states are moving to ban the teaching of slavery in schools. It seems the most common reason provided for this is that discussing slavery makes students uncomfortable and makes them have less respect for their country. 
 
I don't like the idea of "we should only teach kids the good/positive history." I think they need to know the country's history regardless of which things were good and which things were bad. When reading today's news, should you only hear about good things that happened? The reality is that if you are informed about both good and bad things about our country, it helps you with your decision making in life. If our country has a lot of bad things going on, we shouldn't suppress it. We should make it known and simply just do better. How do you address a problem if you don't know there is a problem to begin with? 
 
I think teaching kids about slavery and discrimination based on race is a good idea. I think it is good to be objective/factual. Provide data/stats where needed. It'll make some kids uncomfortable but it's worth it. 
 
<h2>Should schools discuss LGBTQ? 
Some parents feel that schools are forcing LGBTQ beliefs down their kids' throats. I think schools should teach people what LGBTQ stands for and what each letter means. Schools can mention which % of people are LGBTQ in the United States too. I don't think schools need to do much more than that. I don't think schools need to be requiring students to attend pride marches or anything like that. 
 
I do not identify as LGBTQ. I will state that I think there should be no discrimination against LGBTQ. 
 
<h2>Religion 
It seems like something special has been going on because how was Earth made? How was the first person born? So maybe there is a God of some sort. But there's so many different religions and so many different interpretations that it is just tough to know which religion, if any, has the correct interpretation of the world. It just doesn't feel like there is a bunch of obvious evidence as to which one is correct. 
 
I feel that the most important thing is to be as happy as possible and if having a religion will make you happier, then go for it. I think there should be no discrimination based on religion. 
 
I think it is okay for places like schools to provide some basic insight into religion such as which religions are the most common in the United States/world and what are the basic differences between religions. Other than that, I think schools should keep religion out of everything else unless it is specifically a religious school. I think we want to avoid forcing religious views onto people. 
 
<h2>Gun Violence 
It seems the USA has some of the most gun violence per capita in the world. I think our politicians need to start making changes to laws as a result of this. If politicians do not change laws, then I don't think anything will happen and we will continue to have a lot of gun violence. 
 
What should be done? I want to give a disclaimer that I haven't done much research on this topic. My thought is we need to at least do these things: 
-raise the age in which someone can purchase a gun 
-conduct background checks on people who purchase a gun 
-require gun safety training before being able to purchase a gun 
-ban on assault rifles and other dangerous weapons that are not necessary for self-defense 
 
I think researching what other countries with lower gun violence are doing is helpful too. Australia seems to have very few guns and it seems to work. On the other hand, Switzerland has a lot of guns and it seems to work. So it looks like either approach could work. But my understanding is both those countries have strict gun laws. Again, I need to do more research. 
 
<h2>Masks during a pandemic</h2>
Masks do a good job decreasing the chance of you getting sick. I think that whether or not wearing a mask is worth it mostly depends on the risk. The risk has both to do with the probability of getting sick as well as the punishment of getting sick (feeling unwell, lingering symptoms, death). Other than the risk, I think the decision to wear a mask also depends on the downsides of wearing a mask such as the discomfort. I think for the most part, it is best to consult a medical expert and adhere to their recommendations in terms of when to wear a mask because the medical expert is going to know better than anyone else. 
 
I do not view the concept of a mask mandate as unethical if it is done in a scenario in which the risk of sickness is high enough. I think it should primarily be medical experts that determine if/when to have a mask mandate. I think a mask mandate can be ethical or unethical depending on the situation. The same is true for the banning of mask mandates. If the pandemic is in a very tough state and medical experts state we should have mask mandates, then we should have mask mandates. 
 
<h2>Vaccines</h2>
I view vaccines as similar to masks in that they reduce the chance of you getting sick. Which vaccines should you get? Should you avoid any vaccines? How often should you get certain vaccines? Ask a medical expert. 
 
What about vaccine mandates? I have the same view as the mask mandates. Ask the medical experts. A vaccine mandate can be ethical or unethical depending on the situation. Same thing with the banning of vaccine mandates. Unlike masks, vaccines can have some potentially negative side effects. So I think it's important that the vaccines are made very carefully and are very well tested. I don't think a medical expert is going to recommend a vaccine if the medical expert isn't super confident that the vaccine has been tested thoroughly and is safe. Because the medical experts are the most knowledgeable people to know if a vaccine is worth getting, I think you should get a vaccine if medical experts say you should get it. 
 
<h2>Protesting and Rioting</h2>
I think the best way to get positive change is to go out and vote. Another good way is to communicate your views on social media as well as in-person. When that doesn't work, I think peaceful protesting is the next logical step. Probably having a march where people have signs and interview with the media is good. What if that doesn't work? Should the protests become more disruptive until change is made? 
 
There's no doubt that a disruptive protest is going to bring more attention and discussion to an issue. The obvious downside to a disruptive protest is that it inconveniences certain people, has potential economic damage, etc. So for that reason, I think a disruptive protest would only want to be considered if the more peaceful options didn't work. I need to do more research on the topic. I am sure there have been disruptive protests/riots in the past that have brought positive change and disruptive protests/riots in the past that have not brought positive change. I think if I did more research on the success rate of disruptive protests/riots, I will get a better feel for when that might be considered worth it. 
 
<h2>Cultural Appropriation</h2>
I do not participate in cultural appropriation. Enough people find it offensive to where I think it should be avoided. 
 
<h2>Overweight/Underweight?</h2>
I like to be a healthy weight so that I feel good and am likely to live longer with less health issues. Should I request other people who are overweight/underweight that they should lose/gain weight? Should everyone aim to be a healthy weight? 
 
I think that you should aim to be as happy as possible for as long as possible. It might be that being a healthy weight is how you do this. It might be that being overweight or underweight is how you do this. So I cannot for sure say that everyone should aim to be a healthy weight since I don't know which things exactly make everyone happy. I do think that everyone should do some research on health and see what the health impacts are of being overweight/underweight just so they are aware. If you have done the research and want to remain overweight/underweight, that's fine. If you haven't done the research and are overweight/underweight then it might not be obvious to you what the correct course of action is. 
 
I don't think it's my business to inform someone that they should gain/lose weight. I think everyone should be visiting a doctor regularly. The doctor should bring up to the person the health benefits of weight gain/loss if applicable. The person will then take that information and determine which course of action they want to take, if any. 
 
I want to add that I think it's inappropriate to shame someone's figure. 
 
<h2>Climate Change</h2>
It seems that almost all scientists believe in climate change. For this reason, I believe in climate change. I think we should take steps to try and combat climate change. 
 
<h2>Body count</h2>
I don't view it as unethical for someone to have a history involving many different sexual partners. So I don't judge there. It does appear that there is commonly a double standard when it comes to body counts of men vs women. Women seem to be more likely to be shamed for a high body count in comparison to men. I think that is unfair. 
 
<h2>Misogyny</h2>
I think there is no scenario in which it is ever okay to use misogynistic words/slurs towards women. I also think it is inappropriate to request that a woman "cover up" or dress more modestly. I think a woman should be able to wear whatever she wants without being viewed as a sexual object. I don't consider the act of wearing revealing attire to be unethical because it does not harm anyone. I also do not believe in gender roles. I think that a woman doesn't necessarily have to cook, clean, or be a stay-at-home mom. 
 
<h2>Should the woman submit to the man?</h2>
I personally do not like the idea of a woman submitting to me. That would mean that I make all the decisions. I am not qualified to make all the decisions. I have my own strengths and weaknesses. My woman is going to have her own strengths and weaknesses. I think the man and women should both generally have equal say in things. I think that when one person is more knowledgeable in an area than the other, the more knowledgeable person's opinion should hold a little more weight. Otherwise, both people's opinions should hold equal weight. 
 
It seems like in some relationships, both the man and the woman like the idea of the woman submitting to the man. If that's what makes both of them happiest, they should do that. That doesn't make me happiest so I don't do that. 
 
<h2>One data point argument</h2>
I refer to the "one data point argument" as a scenario in which someone makes a generalization about a group/entity based on one data point. For example, suppose Person A has a colleague called Person B who is old. Suppose that Person B is strict. Person A works closely with Person B. Person A might say "I hate working with old people! They are so strict!" In this scenario, Person A is making a "one data point argument." Person A is assuming that most/all old people are strict due to his/her experience with Person B. If you want to make a statement about a group of people, you really should have a lot more than one data point! 
 
Another thing I think that is good when you are making statements like these is to word it as "based on my personal experience ____." This way, you are simply just communicating what you have observed and are not indicating that others in a similar situation will observe the same results. You can also communicate the amount of data points you have and how many of those data points satisfy the X condition so that others can better interpret the situation. 
 
<h2>Cursing</h2>
I do not curse. I don't have an issue with other people cursing. I just think that cursing isn't my personality. 
 
<h2>Police Brutality</h2>
Every field of work has good and bad people. Police officers are no exception. The problem with bad police officers (in comparison to other fields of work) is that bad police officers often result in unnecessary physical harm or even unnecessary deaths. With that in mind, you would think that police officers would be held to a high standard and have significant punishments for their wrong-doings. That's not typically the case. It seems like police officers can commonly get escape punishment many times, even when the whole thing is on camera. 
 
I think there needs to be more consequences for police officers when they abuse their power. This will help decrease the chance that a police officer abuses their power. I understand why it might make sense to have some protections for police officers. Sometimes there is a split-second decision that a police officer has to make and it might be the wrong decision. If such accidental mistakes result in cruel punishment, there won't be enough people interested in becoming police officers. So I think protections for obvious accidents and most split-second decisions are fine. But I think that right now there are too many protections. Officers will make bad decisions over the course of 10 minutes and still won't be held accountable at times. 
 
<h2>Dealing with haters</h2>
Haters are looking to get a reaction out of you. They will say something mean to you with the hope that you say something back to you. They want you to say something back because it wastes your time. They also hope that what you say to them is in an angry tone because they are hoping to make you angry because they don't like you. 
 
If the hater is sending you messages online, the best course of action is to not respond. They will eventually get bored. If the hater is saying something out loud to you, you can either not respond or just calmly say "thank you." 
 
<h2>Drinking</h2>
I only drink water. I do not drink alcohol/beer. I don't see a problem with someone else drinking alcohol/beer as long as they are responsible. 
 
<h2>Smoking</h2>
I do not smoke and have no plans of ever smoking. I think that in most scenarios and for most people, smoking is not going to be worth it. But again, the most important thing is to be as happy as possible and in certain scenarios, it may be that smoking is worth it. 
 
<h2>Pronouns</h2>
I don't mind someone informing stating what their pronouns are. While I prefer to not be asked what my pronouns are, I will state my pronouns if asked. I think it is not necessary to ask someone for their pronouns. 
 
<h2>Medications</h2>
Take the recommended dosage of medication that your doctor requested that you take. If you think that the dosage might not be sufficient, explain the situation to your doctor and see what your doctor recommends. Do not give anyone else your prescribed medication. 
 
<h2>Alien from outer space</h2>
I question a lot of things. When questioning something to determine if it makes sense to me, I ask myself: if I were an alien from outer space and I came on over to observe the situation, would the situation make sense to me? For example, why does the woman take the man's last name in marriage as opposed to the man taking the woman's name? Mr. alien from outer space would have no idea. Why does the man propose to the woman? Mr. alien has no idea again. 
 
<h2>Political Parties</h2>
It seems like there is a lot of corruption within political parties in the United States. There may be certain organizations donating to certain politicians that have to make decisions on areas that affect their donors. This creates a conflict of interest and seems totally unfair. 
 
It also seems like a lot of politicians will agree with everything their political party says no matter what. Maybe they don't actually agree in private but in public it sure looks like they will support their political party no matter what. 
 
I don't consider myself to be part of any political party because all political parties seem to have some level of corruption or things I disagree with and I don't want to feel attached to a group that has some things I disagree with. 
 
<h2>Cooking vs eating out</h2>
I strongly prefer cooking over eating at restaurants. This is because when I cook, it 
1) tastes better (I can do more customization on the food I make) 
2) is healthier (I can make sure the ingredients are healthy enough) 
3) saves time (don't have to travel to/from the restaurant or sit at a table while I wait for the food to be made) 
4) is cheaper 
5) is guaranteed to be the right portion size 
6) will not give me food poisoning/upset stomach 
 
I also don't really get food cravings which probably factors into me preferring cooking over restaurants. I kind of just view all restaurants the same. The food tastes about equally good everywhere and the experience feels the same. Some people like the idea of sitting at a booth at a restaurant with a waiter/waitress who takes your order. I view the that type of experience the same at every restaurant and I do not view it as any more enjoyable than simply sitting at a dinner table together at home. I personally only eat out when someone else suggests it and wants to. I would never eat out if I lived alone or if no one specifically requested that I eat out with them. 
 
<h2>Weather preferences</h2>
My favorite weather is 70s and sunny. Most USA cities are too hot or too cold. If I had to choose between two hot and too cold, I would choose the hot weather. I like when the trees and grass look the same in the summer as the winter. I prefer sun the most but I am okay with occasionally gloominess/rain. My favorite weather in order would be 
1) 70 degree weather 
3) 80 degree weather 
4) 60 degree weather 
5) 90 degree weather 
6) rain 
7) snow 
8) thunderstorms 
9) category 5 hurricane 
10) tornadoes 
 
<h2>Beaches or mountains</h2>
Beaches! I like palm trees and they seem to be common in beach towns. I don't really like to go to the beach though. Mountains make me feel uncomfortable for some reason. I guess I'm just used to beaches because I grew up in a beach town. 
 
<h2>Electoral college</h2>
Should there be an electoral college? With an electoral college, it feels like people who live in less populated states have more "voting power" than people who live in populated states. Why not just do a popular vote? The argument against the popular vote is that the less populated states won't have as much say in the election and the populated states may vote for presidential candidates that favor them but not the less populated states. The electoral college was made to give the less populated states more say in the result. It's not obvious to me what the best approach is but I am leaning towards the popular vote. I don't think that the populated states are going to have that much different of an opinion in comparison to the less popular states to where the candidates they vote for are good for the populated states but bad for the less populated states. 
 
<h2>Utilize specialists to where the most knowledgeable person is the one to provide insight</h2>
If I have a question about the heart, I would consult a cardiologist. If I have a question about my teeth, I would consult a dentist. If I have a question about law, I would consult a lawyer. If I have a question about investing, I would consult a financial advisor. 
 
I feel that I get a better answer if I go to someone who specializes in the area that I am asking a question to. They understand the area much more than me so I will give their opinion a lot of weight when making the decision. The same holds true for how I go about choosing to wear a mask or take a vaccine during the pandemic. 
 
<h2>Avoid negativity</h2>
I think there is no need for negativity because it does nothing to improve the situation. An example of this would be saying things like "I hate ___." I think that instead, it is better to be positive and constructive. If there is something that you do not like, is there something you can do about it? If it's an activity that you don't like, is it possible that you can do that activity less? Is there a way to make the activity more fun? If it's a person that you don't like, is it possible to interact with that person less? Is it possible to find a way to make the interaction more enjoyable? If you don't like your job, is there a way for you to find a new job or to make your job more enjoyable? 
 
I think focusing on positivity and improvement is a key way to increase happiness. What can I do to increase my happiness? Brainstorming and implementing improvement actions will make you happier so do it! 
 
<h2>Should male and female athletes make the same income?</h2>
In some scenarios, male and female athletes make the same income and in some scenarios they don't. In tennis, men and women earn the same prize money when competing in the French Open. In basketball, NBA players are compensated much more than WNBA players. The key difference is that the French Open competitors are compensated by the same entity whereas NBA and WNBA athletes are compensated by different entities. 
 
The most common argument for compensating men and women athletes the same is that it is unfair for a woman to earn less money than a man who she works equally as hard as just because she is a woman. The most common argument for not giving men and women equal compensation is that men tend to bring in more viewership. 
 
Should income for athletes be purely based off of supply and demand and irrespective of gender? Most of the fields of work are like that. The sports where one gender is paid more than the other are the sports where income is based off supply and demand. It feels highly unfair for a woman to make less than a man in one area of work just because she is a woman. 
 
I personally think that the approach of male and female athletes earning the same money is the better approach to take. The NBA and WNBA would have to merge into the same organization or have the same parent organization. I don't see that happening, though. 
 
Athletes fall under the category of entertainers. Should male and female entertainers make the same money in all fields of entertainment? Male models earn less than female models. Should we lessen the pay of female models so male models should earn more? 
 
Depending on the field of work, trying to get men and women to earn the same can be a logistics challenge. For now, I'll only comment on male vs female athletes and I'll do more research on what should be done for other fields of work later. 
 
<h2>SFH vs Condo vs Townhome</h2>
I prefer a SFH because of the peace and quiet and having a yard. 
 
<h2>Movies</h2>
I do not watch movies. I get sleepy during movies. I think it has to do with having to stay focused for too long. 
 
<h2>TV</h2>
I don't watch much TV. I will watch sports probably once per month. 
 
<h2>Most impressive/difficult accomplishments/strengths</h2>
1) Got top 4 in the world in Hero Battles on Guild Wars. Guild Wars was a game that was played by over 7 million people. 
2) On Guild Wars 2, I lead a guild that had over 5000 members and I was in the top 99.5 percentile of players (subjective). I would periodically lead a group of around 70 people in battle. 
3) My typing speed is around 120wpm which puts me in the 99.7 percentile. 
4) I don't know what my vertical leap used to be but at 5 foot 7, I was able to touch the rim. I could never dunk. 
5) I read over 110 software engineering-related textbooks over a span of 7.5 months. Each book was around 270 pages on average. This comes out to one book every 2.08 days or 3.4 books per week or 130 pages per day. 
6) I can throw a baseball or tennis ball very far (compared to others) if I have a running start. 
7) January-March 2022 interviewing. I did over 107 interviews for Software Engineering jobs and ended up getting a very nice offer. 
 
<h2>City vs Suburb vs Rural</h2>
I like the idea of living in a suburb of a big city. More specifically, I prefer the suburb to be low crime, have good schools, and to be not too crowded. A population density of 2000-4000 is fine for me. The right suburb tends to have a lower crime rate than the big city. The suburb with the lower crime rate than the big city and is often cheaper than the big city too. Living near a big city is nice because you can drive into the big city for its amenities such as a large airport. Having the ability to take a direct flight to many different locations is important to me. 
 
<h2>Race/Ethnicity</h2>
When discussing race/ethnicity with someone in the USA, I use the US Census definitions of race and ethnicity. See https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html. One common point of confusion is people referring to Hispanic/Latino as a race. Someone who identifies as Hispanic/Latino may be of any race as per the US census. Hispanic/Latino is an ethnicity, which is separate from race. Each country has their own definitions of race/ethnicity. So if I am discussing race/ethnicity with someone outside of the USA, I would mention the US Census definitions as the way things are viewed in the United States but I wouldn't view their interpretation of race/ethnicity as wrong if it is different than the US Census definition. 
 
<h2>Objective vs Subjective</h2>
I like to try and make things objective whenever possible. It feels fairer. 
 
<h2>Criminal Justice System</h2>
The United States has the largest incarceration rate in the world. In addition to that minorities seem to be targeted disproportionately in terms of being more likely to be placed in jail and more likely to have a longer jail sentence for the same wrong-doing as a white person. I think we need to make a significant overhaul to our criminal justice system. 
 
<h2>Reparations</h2>
A common talking point is whether or not black Americans should get reparations for slavery. It looks to me like Japanese-Americans received reparations after WW2 due to being placed in internment camps for 4 years. I think the US Government needs to be consistent with their rulings. If Japanese-Americans are getting reparations for 4 years of internment camps, then I think black Americans ought to receive reparations for 400 years of slavery.
